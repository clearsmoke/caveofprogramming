Use single quotes when you do not want a statement expanded/evaluated and double quotes when you do
    For example:
	print("$file was found in Folder\n") 
	    This would substitue the variable for $file as well as interprit the \n new line character. Using single quotes would only interpret	    that statement as a literal string.

use $ for declaring single variables (scalars) and use @ for Arrays

You can use the -f flag to ask/indicate whether a file exists or not
    Example:
	if(-f $file) {
	    print("Found $file\n");
	}
	    This says that if the file at variable $file is found then print that you found the file

To turn off output buffering set the value to 1
    Example: 
	use strict;
	use warnings;
	$| = 1;
